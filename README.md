## Introduction

This project represents my initial exploration into Java programming. The ultimate goal is to evolve it into a full-fledged interactive game with a graphical user interface.

## About the Game

Monster Cards is a text-based card game where players navigate through a dungeon using a deck of cards. The game involves battling monsters, casting spells, and acquiring equipment to level up and overcome obstacles.

### How to Play

1. **Setup:**
   - Each player starts with a basic deck of cards.
   - The goal is to reach a certain level by defeating monsters.

2. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Players take turns drawing cards and engaging in battles with monsters.
   - Cards include monsters, spells, and equipment, each with unique effects.
   - Spells can be used to enhance your abilities or hinder your opponents.

3. **Winning:**
   - The first player to reach the predetermined level (level 10) is declared the winner.
   - Levels are gained by defeating monsters in battles or with spells.

## Project Background

This project was developed as part of a school assignment. The objective was to adapt the game mechanics of Munchkin and create cards related to our academic courses and the school environment. Therefore, the game is primarily in French to align with the project's educational context.

## Future Development

The vision for this project includes implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging and interactive gaming experience. This will involve transitioning from the current text-based format to a visually appealing interface.

## Challenges and Achievements

### Problems Encountered
- Balancing game mechanics for a fair and enjoyable experience.
- Addressing complexities in card interactions.
- Creating the effect of hundreds of cards.
- Implementing GUI.

### Successes
- Successful implementation of core game mechanics.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of Java fundamentals.
- Creating a foundation for future GUI development.
